# Nasa-Battery

This project aims to develop a simple machine learning model to predict the current state of a lithium ion battery, using voltage and temperature data from charging and discharging cycles. In particular, we aim to predict battery state of health (SoH), as measured by capacity in Ah, and battery remaining useful life (RUL), as measured by the number of charge/discharge cycles until 70% capacity fade. 

We use publically available battery data published by NASA: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#battery.
